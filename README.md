📌 Loan Status Classification (Python)
📝 Project Description
This project implements a simple Python function that determines loan application status based on two numeric inputs: monthly income and credit score.
The goal is to practice:
Handling multiple parameters in functions
Writing clean conditional logic
Validating invalid input values
Simulating real-world decision rules
⚙️ How It Works
The function returns one of the following statuses:
invalid – negative values are not allowed
rejected – low income and low credit score
review – borderline cases that require manual review
approved – acceptable income and credit score
▶️ Example
Copy code
Python
loan_status(5, 75)
# Output: "approved"
